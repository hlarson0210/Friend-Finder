## What does this app solve?
This app introduces you to express.js and the GET / POST methods within for file and data sharing.

## App Overview
This app is organized through the express path method where each `.js` file is exported through functions to which the `server.js` file is able to require them and run the functions on the exported `.html` pages.

## How to use
This app is deployed to Heroku:
Once in the app, click on links throughout the pages to run the functionality:
1. Take the Survey
2. Return to the home page
3. View the api link to the JSON data
